## Python Code Challenges: Control Flow
### 1. Large Power
For the first code challenge, we are going to create a method that tests whether the result of taking the power of one
number to another number provides an answer which is greater than 5000. We will use a conditional statement to return
`True` if the result is greater than 5000 or return `False` if it is not. In order to accomplish this, we will need the
following steps:
1. Define the function to accept two input parameters called `base` and `exponent`
2. Calculate the result of base to the power of exponent
3. Use an `if` statement to test if the result is greater than 5000. If it is then return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`

### Solution
```python
def large_power(base: int, exponent: int):
    result = 1
    for x in range(exponent):
        result = result * base

    print(result)
    if result > 5000:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
### 2. Over Budget
Letâ€™s say we are trying to save some money, and we are watching our budget. We need to make sure that the result of our
spending is less than the total amount we have allocated for each of the categories. Our function will accept a
parameter called `budget` which describes our spending limit. The next four parameters describe what we are spending our
money on. We need to sum all of our spending's and compare it to the budget. If we have gone over budget, we will return
`True`. Otherwise, we return False. Here are the steps we need:
1. Define the function to accept five parameters starting with `budget` then `food_bill`, `electricity_bill`, `internet_bill`, and `rent`
2. Calculate the sum of the last four parameters
3. Use `if` and `else` statements to test if the budget is less than the sum of the calculated sum from the previous step.
4. If the condition is true, return `True` otherwise return `False`

### Solution
```python
def over_budget(budget, food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill, rent):
    if food_bill + electricity_bill + internet_bill + rent > budget:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### 3. Twice As Large
In this challenge, we will determine if one number is twice as large as another number. To do this, we will compare the
first number with two times the second number. Here are the steps:

1. Define our function with two inputs `num1` and `num2`
2. Multiply the second input by 2
3. Use an `if` statement to compare the result of the last calculation with the first input
4. If `num1` is greater than return `True` otherwise return `False`

### Solution
```python
def twice_as_large(num1, num2):
    num2 = num2 * 2
    if num1 > num2:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### 4. Divisible By Ten
To make things a bit more challenging, we are going to create a function that determines whether a number is
divisible by ten. A number is divisible by ten if the remainder of the number divided by 10 is 0. Using this, we can
complete this function in a few steps:

1. Define the function header to accept one input `num`
2. Calculate the remainder of the input divided by 10 (use modulus)
3. Use an `if` statement to check if the remainder was 0. If the remainder was 0, return `True`, otherwise, return `False`

### Solution
```python
def divisible_by_ten(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### 5. Not Sum To Ten
Finally, we are going to check if the summation of two inputs does not equal ten. Our function will accept two inputs
and add them together. If the two numbers added together are not equal to ten, then we will return `True`, otherwise, we
will return `False`. Here is what we need to do:

1. Define the function to accept two parameters, `num1` and `num2`
2. Add the two parameters together
3. Test if the result is not equal to 10
4. If the sum is not equal, return `True`, otherwise, return `False`

### Solution
```python
def not_sum_to_ten(num1, num2):
    if num1 + num2 != 10:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
